        <p class="lead">Orchids come in many different "flavors". They are a very diverse tropical plant! On this page you can find information about the numerous kinds of Orchids out there - most of which you can find to purchase!</p>

          <p>There are hundreds of different kinds of orchids available out there. Depending on where you look you can find different colors, species and hybrids, miniature or standard size and different genera.

        <h3>Moth Orchids</h3>
        <p>Moth orchids are the orchid that you'll be able to find the easiest - they're the most common orchid you'll see around. You can find these orchids in most grocery stores (like Kroger) and garden supply stores (like Lowes or Home Depot). They come in a variety of colors and even though they are the most readily availible, they're still very exotic and elegant.
        Moth orchids consist of Phalaenopsis genus (Phal) which has approximately 60 species. These orchids are one of the most popular of the different genus of orchids. The Phalaenopsis orchids are nicknamed moth orchids. A large species of moths was given the name Phalena by Carl Linnaeus and  since these orchids resemble a moth in flight.
        These orchids are native to southeast Asia and range from the Himalayan mountains to the islands of Polillo, Palawan and Zamboanga del Norte in the Philippines as well as northern Australia. In the wild, most of these plants grow blow the canopies of moist and humid lowland forests protected from direct sunlight. There are some species that grow seasonally in dry or cool environments as well but they are primarily found in humid areas.
        These plants produce a single growing stem with one or two alternate, thick, fleshy, elliptical leaves. A very healthy Phal can have up to ten or more leaves. The inflorescence (flowering spike) appears from the stem between the leaves. These plants bloom fully for several weeks and if kept in the home they may last 2-3 months. These are also considered to be one of the easier orchids to take care of (which is discussed in the care section!).</p>

        <h3> Dendrobium Orchids</h3>
        <p>The Dendrobium genus (Den) was established by Olof Swartz in the late 1700’s and contains ~1200 species. These plants can be found in diverse habitats ranging from China to India down to islands in the Pacific. The name is derived from the Greek Dendron (meaning tree) and bios (meaning life) – translating to “one who lives on trees”, or, epiphyte. These plants can be found in a wide variety of habitats ranging from high altitudes to lowland tropical forests and even desert climates.
        These plants look a bit different than the Phal orchid plants. The Dendrobium species develop pseudobulbs which vary in length from very short (under a centimeter) to extremely long (several meters). A few of these grow into long reedlike stems. As far as leaves go, the leaf base forms sheath that envelope the stem.            Dendrobium orchids grow quickly throught the summer but they take a long rest during the winter. Buds develop into shoots from the base of the pseudobulb primarily in the spring but this occasionally happens in the fall, this is followed by rapid growth of new roots.</p>

        <h3> Boat Orchids</h3>
        <p>Boat orchids consist of the Cymbidium genus which contains 52 evergreen species. They’re called boat orchids because the Latin genus name is derived from the Latin cymba which means boat. This species can be found in tropical and subtropical Asia and northern Australia.
        Cymbidium orchids grow to a height of 5 ft and the racemes can get as high as 7.5 ft while each flower can have a diameter of 5-10 cm. These plants bloom in the winter with each plant carrying up to 15 flowers, sometimes more. The blooms last about 10 weeks and have a waxy texture. These orchids are one of the species that are fragrant – particularly the Chinese cymbidiums. One unique feature about these orchids is that they can survive during cold temperatures. This species is also considered to be a delicacy in Bhutan where it is traditionally cooked in a spicy curry or stew called “olachoto”.</p>

        <h3> Slipper Orchids</h3>
        <p>The slipper orchid group consist primarily of the Cypripedioideae subfamily and the Cypripedium genus. They get their nickname from the Greek word “Cypris” and “pedilon” (meaning sandal). The fused petals that form the orchids pouch (or modified lip) resemble a slipper or shoe. This genus consists of around 50 species that can be found widespread throughout boreal, temperature, and tropical regions of Europe, North American and Asian continents. Twelve species are found in the US and 11 are found on National Forest System Land. In North America, these plants are hardy terrestrial plants that can grow in cold climates and they flower in early to mid-spring when there is plentiful moisture.
        These flowers have been sought after and collected for medicinal trade for centuries but widespread collection, attempts at transplantation, and loss of habitat have drastically reduced their numbers. This has made them difficult to cultivate and they rarely survive being transplanted from the wild – because of this in the US it is currently illegal to dig or pick these orchids on federal lands.
        Besides the Cypripedium genus the Mexipedium, Paphiopedilum, Phragmipedium, and Selenipedium genera also belong to the Slipper orchid group.</p>
