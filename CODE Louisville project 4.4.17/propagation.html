        <h2>How to Propagate Orchids</h2>
        <p class="lead">Propagating orchids can be kind of scary, especially if you dont know much about the process. It's not an easy task but there are a few different ways you can go about doing this - all but 2 of these methods can be done at home!</p>

        <h3>Division Propagation</h3>
        <p>The division method for propagation sounds exactly like what you would expect it to mean - you're literally splitting the plant into 2 or more parts each having at least one new shoot and each will produce a fully grown mostly flowering sized plant that is capable of producing flowers and blooming the following season.</p>
        <p>This method is probably the simplest method but the thought of cutting your orchid into two or more parts is kind of scary. Even though this method may sound a bit on the dangerous side to many orchid owners, there are reasons that this is useful for increasing your stock but also its beneficial for the plant itself. Splitting the plant will encourage the plant to produce more shoots which will be a better quality than would be the ones produces if the plant was left to grow on its own. The process of dividing the plant results in much more vigorous growth because of the plants response to the stress of being divided as well as being introduced to fresh potting medium.</p>
        <p>It is important to only divide plants when each division will have at least 3 back bulbs and each division should only have 1 new growth</p>

                <img src="Orchid Images/orchid division2.jpg" alt="division" style= "width:300px;height:200px">
   
        <h3>Back Bulb Propagation</h3>
        <p>Back bulbs are the the older generation of growth that have been removed from an orchid. This method of propagation produces a new plant from older plants that have previoudly flowered or unflowered back pseudobulbs (these are ususally leafless). Using this method, it takes roughly 2-3 years, maybe more, for the plant to flower. Although this method takes a few years to yeild results, it is the easiest method for propagation.</p>
        <p>Inorder to propagate an orchid using this method all you do is remove the older back bulbs (so ones that have previously flowered) when repotting and then keep the bulbs in conditions that promote root development. If you get to the point of promoting root formation then youre pretty much half way to a new plant! The plants that result from the back bulb method are still the same plant. They wont be clones but they will be almost identical.</p>

                <img src="Orchid Images/orchid backbulbs.jpg" alt="backbulbs">
          
        <h3>Keiki Propagation</h3>
        <p>Another method of propagation that can be done at home is through the keiki method. A keiki is the product of asexual propagation by mature plants that results in an exact clone. Keikis occur naturally, this occurs when growth hormones accumulate at a node on the flowering spike. Keiki paste can also be used to stimulate the formation of Keikis.</p>
        <p>When a keiki has developed several leaves and roots that are 2-3 inches in length, the keiki can be removed from the parent orchid - but removing a keiki too early can cause the keiki to die. Once a keiki is capable of surviving on its own it can be carefully removed from the parent plant using a sharp, sterile blade and cutting the keiki away by slicing the tissue at the base of the plantlet. Any time there is an open wound on your orchid, it needs to
        be treated to prevent fungal infections. You can apply cinnamon, a natural fungicide, to the cuts on both the mother plant and keiki to ward off future problems.</p>
        <p>Once the keiki has been removed there are 2 options - you can pot the keiki in its own 4â€³ container or repot the mother plant along with the keiki in the same pot. During its first year, a keiki can benefit from being potted with its mother as the mature plant will help regulate soil conditions for the sensitive keiki.</p>
        <p>With the proper care, your keiki should flower between 2 to 3 years of age. You may, however, get lucky and experience flowering after just a year.</p>            
        <p>While the appearacne of a keiki can be fun, they can also be a sign that your plant is under a lot of stress. Sometimes an orchid will put off a keiki as a way of continuing its legacy if it fears that death is in the future. Keiki production should not instill panic but should act as a reminder to constantly monitor the health and happiness of your original plant.</p>

        <h3>Aerial Cutting Propagation</h3>
        <p>The pseudobulbs, stems and inflorescence stalks of some orchids make suitable propagating material when they are divided into cuttings. Each section must contain one or more dormant buds. Detached from the rest of the plant and kept in suitably humid surroundings, for example laid on a bed of damp moss or inserted in a pan of moist grit, the buds arising from these sections will form new plantlets. After a few months they can be removed from the old piece of plant and potted up individually.</p>
        <p>The cane-like stems of Epidendrum and Dendrobium will often yield new plants in this way. The basal parts of the inflorescence stalks of Phalaenopsis, Phaius and Calanthe also have a few dormant which will each make a new plantlet under appropriate conditions. On many pseudobulbs, dormant buds will occasionally develop little plants, sometimes known as â€˜keikisâ€™, quite spontaneously â€“ often to be seen on the top of Pleione pseudobulbs and on Epidendrum inflorescences. These can be removed and potted up as soon as they have a few roots to support their independent growth.</p>
        
        <h3>Meristem or Tissue Culture Propagation</h3>
        <p>Meristem propagation is one of 2 methods that cant really be done at home. Meristem culture is done under laboratory conditions as extreme cleanliness and sterility are required otherwise all attempts will fail. This is a highly skilful and scientific method of propagation where the very growing centre of a new growth bud is taken and grown on by agitating constantly in a special nutrient rich liquid until the cell mass is large enough to be split in to small sections. These are then either grown on/in to plants or the process is repeated to produce even more tissue for growing on. This method is often used to mass produce a specific hybrid for commercial purposes.</p>
        <p>Meristem tissue culture is not really suitable for attempting at home beacause the sterility usually can't be achieved, you can of course buy flasks of the finished tissue cultures for growing on but this process will take between 3 and 5 years to get a flowering size plant.</p>
          
        <h3>Seed and Flasking Propagation</h3>
        <p>Propagating orchids using seeds is the 2nd method that cant really be carried out at home. Orchid seeds are very tiny. Each consists of only a tiny embryo surrounded by a single layer of protective cells. They are so small that the food reserves in the embryo are inadequate, by themselves, for the early development of the new plant. In nature most orchid seeds begin life in a partnership with a symbiotic fungus. The fungal hyphae; which are present in the soil or on the bark of a host tree, invade the seed and enter the cells of the embryo. The orchid soon begins to digest the fungal tissue and obtain nutrients form it, thus using the fungus as an intermediary in obtaining nutrients from decaying material in the soil.
        <p>In the laboratory this process can be imitated by sowing sterilized seeds with a culture of the fungus on a suitable jelly-like medium called agar with the addition of porridge oats which the fungus can utilize. A simpler method is to use a medium containing all the mineral nutrients, water and sugar that the germinating seed needs and dispense with the fungus. All these techniques must be carried out in sterile conditions â€“ otherwise it is extremely easy for the nutrient medium to become infected with unwanted micro-organisms that develop at the expense of the orchid. The work can be carried out in the kitchen, using a domestic pressure cooker to sterilize the greenhouse and growing media. A sterile box or even a large polythene bag can be used as a cover for the operation which should be carried out as speedily as possible. However, the technique is more easily successfully performed in a specialized laboratory on a laminar flow bench.</p>
        <p>Conical flasks, petri dishes or sterile bottles containing the newly sown seeds are kept under controlled conditions while the embryo grows out through the seed-coat to form, first, a rounded protocorm covered in rhizoids and then a small plantlet. Sometimes the containers need to be kept in the dark for the first few months, but the epiphytic orchids develop green protocorms almost immediately and are kept under artificial light for 12-16 hours per day. Although the flasks are sealed, the medium becomes too solid through dehydration after a few months, and the plantlets need to be transferred to freshly prepared medium in a new container. These techniques must also be carried out under sterile conditions. Eventually, about six to twelve months after sowing, the plantlets are large enough to be taken out of the flask, washed carefully to remove all traces of agar, and then potted up in a fine compost mix. For their first few weeks in the greenhouse they need special care. Extra warmth and humidity, as can be provided in a small propagating case, is often beneficial. Different kinds of orchids develop at different rates. Some of the quickest are the Phalaenopsis species and hybrids which can grow from seeds to flowering size in as little as 18-20 months. Others take much longer. Four to six years is an average length of time for most orchids.</p>
