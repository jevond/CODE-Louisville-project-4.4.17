        <p class="lead">Orchids are some of the most common house plants found in many homes and are considered a symbol of love and beauty.  With the proper care and growing conditions it really isn't difficult to take care of these luxurious plants.  Throughout this site youll find information of orchid care, propagation, history, and much more!</p>

        <h3>Moth Orchid Care</h3>
        <p>Moth orchids are the most commonly found orchids so there is more out there on how to best take care of them.</p>
        <p>Most often, moth orchids die because of over watering. It is extremely easy to overwater an orchid. The potting medium for orchids is generally bark of sphagnum moss. Both need to be allowed to dry out between watering’s. When the bark or moss is dry and the pot feels lighter than it does after watering then it is time to water! It is important to never leave orchid roots in standing water. Most orchids some in a plastic pot that has holes in the bottom (even if your orchid comes in a nice ceramic pot it will still be in the plastic so you can just pull it out of the nicer pot), so what is easiest to do is to hold the pot under running water to wet the medium while letting the excess water drain out of the bottom of the pot. The orchid can now be put back in its decorative pot until the next watering. Some of the Phals available for purchase instruct the buyer to add a specific amount of ice cubes to the top of the potting mix once a week, but even with these orchids you can use the method described above.</p>
        <p>Other requirements the orchid needs include light – but not bright direct light. It is best to put your orchid in an east-facing window. The important part is that the sunlight the plant receives is not direct light. Normal house temperatures are fine for orchids – ranges include 70-80 degrees during the day and around 60 degrees at night. Orchids also need to be fertilized to aid in plant growth. The fertilizing schedule will depend on the type or brand of fertilizer you buy. Phals prefer a 20-20-20 or 10-10-17 composition for fertilizer. Most brands suggest fertilizing every other week while the orchid is in bloom and maybe once a month when not in bloom.</p>
        <p>The blooms of your orchid will eventually fall off- this does NOT mean that the orchid is dead! It is still very much alive! Once the blooms have fallen off you should cut the bloom spike – this will result in new or more spikes growing for the next bloom cycle. It’s important to use sterile scissors to cut the spike then to add something to the cut area that prevents disease – cinnamon is a good choice. After the blooms have fallen off is the best time to repot your orchid. It’s important to pick a pot that has draining holes and one that is just big enough to fit all the roots- orchids don’t want big containers! You can find different potting mixes at different stores and nurseries and it’s up to you as to which you prefer. A bark and moss mix is what I would suggest (there is a link in the resources section to a good site to buy potting mix). Re-potting only needs to be done every few years, no more than once a year. Orchids should bloom once a year or so.</p>
   
        <h3> Dendrobium Orchid Care</h3>
        <p>Dendrobium orchids require a bit different when it comes to care. These orchids prefer to be watered in the morning with room temperature water. The frequency with which you water is depend primarily on the season and its growth cycle. When the plant is growing actively then it should be watered once a week. Watering should be reduced in the fall to help encourage bud growth and in winter watering should only be done when you see that the pseudobulbs are starting to shrivel (which is an indicator of the plant not getting enough water). These orchids prefer medium light conditions – an eastern facing windowsill is based but a southern facing sill that is shaded will also work. Temperatures that Den orchids prefer ranges from 75 degrees to 85 degrees during the day (not exceeding 90 degrees) and between 60 degrees and 65 degrees at night. </p>
        <p>These orchids need to be fertilized regularly when they are actively growing – so fertilize every 2-3 weeks during the summer months and once a month during the winter.</p>
        <p>These orchids also need to be re-potted every 1-2 years but only after the blooms fall. These orchids prefer a medium-grade mix. These orchids also prefer to be snuggly fit in their pots instead of being in pots that are too big.</p>
          
        <h3> Boat Orchid Care</h3>
        <p>Boat orchids, like others, do not need watering often. These orchids should be watered preferably in the morning using tepid water. This will allow the potting mix to dry before lower night time temperatures start to set in. When these orchids are actively growing, the potting mix should be kept slightly damp (not soggy!). During warmer months, you will want to water these orchids more frequently – up to once a week-while it will be needed less frequently in the cooler months. These orchids prefer medium to bright light intensity and do best with as much light as possible. If the orchid is getting the optimal amount of sunlight then the leaves will be a yellow green color. Too much light will cause the leaves to turn yellow while to little light will cause the leaves to turn dark green. An east facing windowsill is best for these orchids but a shaded southern facing window works as well. Boat orchids prefer temperatures ranging from 75 degrees to 85 degrees in the day and 50 degrees to 60 degrees at night. These orchids need to be fertilized regularly while they are blooming and it is recommended that a 20-20-20 formula solution is used. During the winter the plants should be fertilized once a month. These orchids should be repotted every 2 years in a course mix. They should be repotted in the spring after the flowers have bloomed (unlike the Phal and Den orchids).</p>
          
        <h3> Slipper Orchid Care</h3>
        <p>Slipper orchids are one of the more uncommon ones to have around therefore their care is a little more difficult and there aren't the kind of resources out there that there are for Phal and Den orchids.</p>
        <p>Slipper orchids are unique in that they can be found in shady woodlands and they prefer environments that mimic this when grown in the home. Watering is again an important aspect of care for these orchids as with the others. The potting mix for these orchids should be kept moist using distilled or rainwater. These orchids don’t require much by way of fertilizing and applying fertilizer once or twice between the spring and early summer is sufficient. These plants grow best and prefer slightly dark or shaded areas with no direct sunlight but fluorescent bulbs can work well for them. They also prefer a temperature between 70 degrees and 80 degrees for growth. Slipper orchids aren’t as common in the home as Phal and Den orchids are so they can be more difficult to take care of but it can be done! </p>
