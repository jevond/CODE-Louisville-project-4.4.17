        <h2>Some Orchid Background</h2>
        <p class="lead">Orchids are one of the oldest flowering plants and over time, they have developed a complex relationship with their pollinating counterparts. The colors, shapes and smells of orchids have made them attractors of specific insects that transport their polen packets (which are called pollinia) from one plant to another. Orchids can continue to survive in the wild without this pollination process interestingly. A way they can do this is by utilizing a common mode of spreading, division. Orchids naturally grow on the trunks of trees so it is not uncommon for part of the host tree, or part of the orchid itself, to be broken off during incidents of high wind, storms or other adverse situations. The parts of the orchid that break off can continue to survive and thrive as plants on their own, wherever they may land - but the area has to be hospitable to the orchids specific needs.
        Not only are orchids one of the oldest flowring plants, they also have a long history with humans. For example, in ancient Greece, orchids were deemed to be aphrodisiacs. In modern-day Mexico, the Totonic peopl and the Aztecs (who conquered the Totonic) cultivated the seed pods of the Vanilla orchid as a flavoring which has since become one of the most popular flavorings in the world. Other cultures have used the orchid for medicinal purposes- in traditional Chinese medicine it was used to help cure coughs and lung illnesses while in ancient Greece they were associated with virility and male fertility. Charles Darwin wrote extensively on orchids. He wrote volumes on the pollination of orchids.the Angraecum sesquipedale orchid of Madagascar is often called Darwins orchid - primarily because he believed that based on the structure of the orchid there must be a butterfly or moth species with a proboscis long enough to pollinate the orchid (the moth Xanthopan morganii praedicta fit his hypothesis and was discovered 21 years after his death).
        During the mid-19th century Victorian era "orchid hunters" popularized the orchid among horticulturists but also served a negative impact by plundering much of the orchids native habitat in the process. Frederick Sander - Queen Victoria's royal orchid grower- employed numerous orchid huntersto bring exotic orchids from South America to England. Many of the orchids grown today are actually named after these orchid hunters but during the time there was no concern for conservation by these individuals. Orchid hybridization became popular during this era and Sanders was the first to publish a list of orchid hybrids.
        Today, orchid growers and collectors tend to give much more thought to orchid habitat conservation than those in the Victorian era. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITIES) included orchids and has helped to work to the detriment of orchi conservation, even though it is more effective for animals than orchids. Numerous orchid conservation organizations exist today on a national and an international stage and include groups dedicated to preserving the native habitat to propagating species in a greenhouse setting to preserve habitats.
        Today, there are more than 25,000 different types of orchids known to exhist naturally. They grow in every continent (except for Antarctica) and they come in hundreds of shapes and sizes. Around 1% of the 25,000 orchids only grow in virtually inaccessible habitats and have only been seen a handful of times.
        Orchids also come in just about every color. Orchid bloom in every color - from white to green to deep fuchsia-but they do not bloom in black. There are true blue orchids, you wont find them in stores - the blue orchids you find in stores are dyed orchids, the true blues are rare. Orchids also bloom in color combinations like lavender and pink! They are very versatile and are perfect for stand alone centerpeices or additions to other arrangements for that reason.
        Orchids are much more intersting than many of the other types of popular flowers you see around today. Their history is more complex - whats been discussed here is just a fraction of the history surrounding orchids!</p>
